# kaspersky-to-csv
 Converts the .txt files generated by Kaspersky Password Manager into CSV file, similar to the ones exported by Chromium browsers, for use in transferring/switching to other password managers.


Currently supports the following entries:
- Accounts (username, password, URL, notes)
- Applications (app name, username, password, notes)

### Does this actually work?
Yes, it does. I have tested it with the .txt files generated by Kaspersky Password Manager 23.2.0.242 / 1701842894_7518 / 1.1.0.2_1 and with 540 entries. The output CSV file was successfully imported into Dashlane.

## Usage
There is both a Python and a HTML/JS version of the script. The Python version is more feature-complete, but the JS version is more portable and has a basic web interface.

### JS
The JS version is written in HTML and JavaScript. It should work in any modern browser, but has only been tested in Chromium-based browsers.

This is available as a GitHub Pages site at https://draggie306.github.io/kaspersky-to-csv.

### Python
The Python version is written in Python 3.10.7 but should work with any Python 3 version. `csv`, `os` and `time` are the only dependencies.

To use the Python version, run `python3 kaspersky-txt-to-csv.py` and input the path to the .txt file when prompted. The script will output a .csv file in the same directory as the .txt file.
